Welcome to Personal-AI, PersonAI.
=================================

This is a tool designed to make working with AI easier.

The system this is intended for is an LLM (Large Language Model). You
can think of it as an absolutely huge amount of text with an index that
is so **smart** it sounds just like a person.

Although it does not have a **personality**, it can feel like it has
one. It only works **forward**, meaning quite often you'll need to ask
it again about something that was said before. This tool will help with
that. Although it can understand almost anything, it works best when you
ask a question, or a **prompt**.

How to Ask an LLM Something: The **Prompt**
===========================================

Basically, you should think in one of three directions:

1.  **Reductive**: Think of this like asking for the "elevator pitch" of
    a movie. You want the key points or the gist, nothing more. To get
    this from an LLM, you could ask, "What's the most important thing I
    should know about climate change?" Here, you're looking for a
    condensed answer that gets straight to the point.

2.  **Transformational**: Imagine you have a puzzle, but the pieces
    aren't fitting together in your mind. A transformational question is
    like asking someone to show you the puzzle from a different angle.
    For example, if you're confused about how interest rates work, you
    could ask the LLM, "Can you explain interest rates to me like I'm a
    farmer?" This way, the LLM might use farming analogies to make the
    concept more relatable to you.

3.  **Generative**: Think of this like asking for a recipe twist on
    classic chocolate chip cookies. You know what cookies are, but you
    want to explore something new. A generative question prompts the LLM
    to think outside the box. So, if you're familiar with the basics of
    exercise but want to mix it up, you could ask, "What are some
    unconventional ways to get regular exercise?" This invites creative
    or new ideas you might not have considered.

In essence, when crafting your prompt:

-   **Reductive** means you're asking for just the headlines.
-   **Transformational** means you're asking to have the info served in
    a way you can better relate to.
-   **Generative** means you're asking for something new to be created
    from known ingredients.

Tools and Buttons
=================

On the right, you will find these buttons:
------------------------------------------

1.  **Display Label**: What this node is or will be called.

2.  **Edit the Text**: Edit the text in the main box. Try it with this
    introduction. Don't worry; this will be restored when you restart
    the tool.

    *On a side note, you can also use this tool as an editor by typing
    Markdown, showing it as HTML, and then copying it using the
    clipboard to, e.g., Notepad or Pluma. Try it.*

3.  **Font Size**: Changes the size of the text in the main box.

4.  **Shape**: Change the shape of this node.

5.  **Apply**: The changes will be applied to the selected node, or a
    new one will be created.

6.  **Clear**: Clears the text in the main box (this text). If you do so
    by error, simply do not also press **Apply**.

On the top, you will find these buttons:
----------------------------------------

1.  **Welcome!**: In green, replaces the contents with this text. No
    worries if that was not what you intended to do, use Load and fetch
    the file "LastClear".
2.  **Exit**: Close down the tool. No questions asked, but a file
    "LastExit" will be created.
3.  **Bigger Text**: Make all text bigger.
4.  **Smaller Text**: Make all text smaller.
5.  **Save**: Save everything to a file.
6.  **Load**: Load everything from a file.
7.  **Clear All**: Deletes everything. No questions asked, but a file
    "LastClear" will be created.
8.  **Start Vagrant**: Starts the Vagrant tool. This is an advanced
    option.
9.  **Check Vagrant Logs**: This is an advanced option.
10.  **Stop Vagrant**: Stops the Vagrant tool. This is an advanced
    option.
