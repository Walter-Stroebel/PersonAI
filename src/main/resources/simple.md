# Welcome to a simpel AI interface.

Here are the various components:

## <-- On the left is a list of answers you got

You can expand the items to see some details.

Whenever you select an item, the full text will be displayed here.

## On the right are a bunch of buttons -->

Each button is a standard action to tell the LLM to do
something with the text in this central box.

For instance, summarize it, give more details, and so on.

Hover over a button to see the actual instruction.

## At the bottom is where you type your questions.

Just like with a normal chat interface.

Except this does not automatically clear so you can
easily change the question.

Also, there is an explicite send button so no need for
shift-Enter to just type a new line.

Basically a mini text editor.

## Status and commands.

A small progress area and some simple command buttons
complete the interface.

**Export...**: This is a special case, it will save the
entire session in any format _Pandoc_ will recognize
from its extension, see https://pandoc.org

# Have a nice chat!
